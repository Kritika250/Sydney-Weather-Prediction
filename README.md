# DESCRIPTION 
Once upon a time in Sydney, there was a small newspaper company called "The Daily Buzz."The Daily Buzz was founded many years ago by a group of
journalists and entrepreneurs who were passionate about providing accurate and trustworthy news to the people of Sydney. They believed that a 
strong, independent newspaper was vital to the health and well-being of any community, and so they set about creating one.
The Daily Buzz was a small operation at first, with a limited budget and a small team of
dedicated journalists. Despite these challenges, the newspaper quickly gained a reputation for
its high-quality journalism and its commitment to the truth.
Over the years, The Daily Buzz grew and evolved. It added new sections, hired more
journalists, and expanded its reach. Eventually, the newspaper became one of the most widely
read and respected sources of news and information in Sydney.
They were well-known for their interesting articles and local news coverage. However, they were
struggling to attract more readers and stay ahead of the competition.
One day, the editor-in-chief had a brilliant idea. They would start a new column called "The
Weather Oracle," where they would predict the weather for the coming days. This was an
exciting opportunity for the newspaper, as it would provide a unique and useful service to the
community.
The editor handpicked a team of experienced meteorologists to work on the new column. They
were equipped with state-of-the-art technology and the latest weather forecasting tools. The
team worked tirelessly to provide accurate and reliable predictions.
The first edition of "The Weather Oracle" was published on a rainy Monday. The column
included detailed predictions for the week ahead, including the temperature, humidity, and
chances of precipitation. The response was overwhelmingly positive, with many readers saying
they relied on the column to plan their activities for the week.
As the popularity of "The Weather Oracle" continued to grow, the editor-in-chief of The Daily
Buzz realized that they could further improve the accuracy of their weather predictions. With this
in mind, they decided to hire a machine learning expert to create a machine learning model for
rainfall prediction.
The editor-in-chief of "The Daily Buzz.‚Äù has hired you as you are an ML expert and he wants
you to create an ML model to accurately predict the rainfall in Sydney.
